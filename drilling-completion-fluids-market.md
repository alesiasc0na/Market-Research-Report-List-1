<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drilling & Completion Fluids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based systems</li><li>Oil-based systems</li><li>Synthetic-based systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The drilling and completion fluids market consists of three primary types: water-based systems, oil-based systems, and synthetic-based systems. Water-based systems utilize water as the primary base fluid, offering cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. Oil-based systems use oil as the base, providing excellent lubrication and stability in high-temperature conditions but pose environmental challenges. Synthetic-based systems combine properties of both water and oil, delivering superior performance with lower toxicity, making them suitable for complex drilling environments while minimizing ecological impact.</p></p>
