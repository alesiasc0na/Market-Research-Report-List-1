<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inside Exhaust</li><li>Outside Exhaust</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental turbine market can be categorized into two main types based on exhaust design: inside exhaust and outside exhaust turbines. Inside exhaust turbines direct airflow and debris internally, which can provide a quieter operational experience and improved visibility during procedures. In contrast, outside exhaust turbines expel air and debris externally, often resulting in a simpler design and easier maintenance. Both types cater to varying preferences in terms of performance, noise levels, and ease of use in dental practices.</p></p>
