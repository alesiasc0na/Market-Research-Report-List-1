<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Pyrotechnic Pretensioner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Buckle Pretensioner</li><li>Retractor Pretensioner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive pyrotechnic pretensioner market consists of two primary types: buckle pretensioners and retractor pretensioners. Buckle pretensioners are integrated into the seatbelt buckle, deploying during a collision to tighten the seatbelt around the occupant, enhancing safety. Retractor pretensioners, on the other hand, are part of the seatbelt retractor mechanism and activate to pull the belt taut in an impact, minimizing movement and reducing injury risk. Both types contribute significantly to occupant protection in vehicles.</p></p>
